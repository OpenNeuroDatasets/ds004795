Motion simulations were applied to the motion-free (STAND) image volumes of the MR-ART dataset (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004173/versions/1.0.2). As in the MR-ART study, either 5 or 10 nods throughout the scan were simulated. Simulations were performed using 1) The original motion simulation transformation as available in TorchIO (https://torchio.readthedocs.io/transforms/augmentation.html#torchio.transforms.RandomMotion) or 2) a modified version of these simulations allowing non-random movements and a well-defined phase encoding direction in k-space.
